## Filters

How to use (for example, the `Transform` filter).

- Find the filter in the `Filters` menu.
    - Can use `Alphabetical` for access to all filters.
    - If you know the name of the filter, can just `Search...` and start typing.
- Click on whatever filter you've found, which adds it to the bottom left pane in the GUI window.
- Type in whatever inputs you want the filter to have.
- Click `Apply`.
