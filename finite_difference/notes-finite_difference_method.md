> Scikit-fdiff is a python library that aim to solve partial derivative equations without pain. As its name says, it uses *finite difference method* to discretize the spatial derivative. As its name does not say, it is based on [*method of lines*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines) where all the dimension of the PDE but the last (the time) is discretized. That turns the PDE in a high-dimension ODE that can be solved with standard numerical integration of ODEs.
