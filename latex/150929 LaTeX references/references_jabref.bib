  Abstract                 = {Microfluidic automation - the automated routing{,} dispensing{,} mixing{,} and/or separation of fluids through microchannels - generally remains a slowly-spreading technology because device fabrication requires sophisticated facilities and the technology{'}s use demands expert operators. Integrating microfluidic automation in devices has involved specialized multi-layering and bonding approaches. Stereolithography is an assembly-free{,} 3D-printing technique that is emerging as an efficient alternative for rapid prototyping of biomedical devices. Here we describe fluidic valves and pumps that can be stereolithographically printed in optically-clear{,} biocompatible plastic and integrated within microfluidic devices at low cost. User-friendly fluid automation devices can be printed and used by non-engineers as replacement for costly robotic pipettors or tedious manual pipetting. Engineers can manipulate the designs as digital modules into new devices of expanded functionality. Printing these devices only requires the digital file and electronic access to a printer.},

  Abstract                 = {One-step fabrication of transparent three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic to millifluidic devices was demonstrated using a commercial 3D printer costing $2300 with 500 mL of clear resin for $138. It employs dynamic mask projection stercolithography, allowing fast concept-to-chip time. The fully automated system allows fabrication of models of up to 43 mm x 27 mm x 180 mm (x x y x z) at printing speeds of 20 mm/h in height regardless of the design complexity. The minimal cross sectional area of 250 pm was achieved for monolithic microchannels and 200 pm for positive structures (templates for soft lithography). The colorless resin's good light transmittance (>60% transmission at wavelengths of >430 nm) allows for on-chip optical detection, while the electrically insulating material allows electrophoretic separations. To demonstrate its applicability in microfluidics, the printer was used for the fabrication of a micromixer, a gradient generator, a droplet extractor, and a device for isotachophoresis. The mixing and gradient formation units were incorporated into a device for analysis of nitrate in tap water with standard addition as a single run and multiple depth detection cells to provide an extended linear range.},
