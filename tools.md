I want to document my current thoughts about what tools to use for various tasks. Here they are:

- Notes
    - Record notes in Markdown. 
    - The problem is getting a real-time rendering of a markdown document. Solution: [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com)
- Journal papers
    - LaTeX, BibTeX
- Documents (proposals, etc.)
    - Microsoft Word (as little as possible), Endnote
    - LaTeX (as much as possible), BibTeX
- Editor
    - Atom
- Python coding
    - Use Anaconda, latest release (python 3.5 for now)
        - Usually install packages into root env, but occasionally make new envs for special purposes and to test new packages
    - Jupyter notebook for code development and code/narrative/documentation bundled together
    - Occasinally make my own packages for various projects
    - GUI code: PyQt & Qt4
- Drawings
    - png
        - Powerpoint
        - LaTex with Tikz
        - Inkscape
    - Webpages & markdown files
        - SVG
            - Raw, written directly in SVG
            - Inkscape
        - Image tag with png or jpeg files
    - Jupyter notebooks
        - SVG
        - png or jpeg files
- Graphing
    - Static 2D
        - Matplotlib in Jupyter notebooks, make png files as needed
    - Static 2D - webpage
        - png file
        - D3.js
    - Interactive 2D - webpage
        - D3.js looks promising, but must use javascript/html/css. See [Hua's example for measured absorber spectra](https://nanomicro.byu.edu:3456/maingroup/12839)
        - In principle, this can be integrated directly into markdown files (?)
    - Animated 2D - kind of have to do this in a browser
        - HTML 5 Canvas drawings
    - Animated 3D
        - three.js with WebGL - browser so anyone can see and use
        - Python with PyQt and Qt4 - but not easily accessible by others
- Web pages
    - Use bootstrap3 and plain vanilla javascript
    - Serve with either github pages or rawgit from a github respository
    - Or, convert Jupyter notebook to html
- Explore
    - 3D numpy array &rarr; mesh &rarr; stl file
        - [Marching cubes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes): numpy array &rarr; mesh
            - [Surface Extraction: Creating a mesh from pixel-data using Python and VTK](https://pyscience.wordpress.com/2014/09/11/surface-extraction-creating-a-mesh-from-pixel-data-using-python-and-vtk/) - VTK to get mesh
            - [scikit-image.marchingcubes](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html?highlight=marching_cubes#marching-cubes) - python approach to get mesh
        - View mesh and convert to stl file
            - [numpy-stl](http://pythonhosted.org/numpy-stl/usage.html#quickstart) - shows code to plot stl data with matplotlib
            - [trimesh 2.8.5](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trimesh) - Import, export, process, analyze and view (with [pyglet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyglet)) triangular meshes
                - [Example notebook](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/blob/master/examples/quick_start.ipynb)
        - [fstl](https://github.com/mkeeter/fstl) - fast viewer for stl files (needs support for ascii stl files -> look at other guy's fork)
        - VTK for viewing
            - [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org) - program to visualize 3D data
            - [Volume Rendering with Python and VTK](https://pyscience.wordpress.com/2014/11/16/volume-rendering-with-python-and-vtk/)
            - [NumPy to VTK: Converting your NumPy arrays to VTK arrays and files](https://pyscience.wordpress.com/2014/09/06/numpy-to-vtk-converting-your-numpy-arrays-to-vtk-arrays-and-files/)
    - Start using tests for code
        - `assert` statements
        - CLI such as `Travis` so every commit undergoes all tests
    - Sublime Text 3 as editor instead of Atom
    - Need to explore [transcrypt](http://www.transcrypt.org) to write code in python and have it transcribed into javascript so can be seen in a browser. Can use any javascript library, like D3.js and three.js.
    - Vega or vega-lite for static 2D graphs in browser, [Introduction to Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/tutorials/getting_started.html)
    - [plotly](http://moderndata.plot.ly/15-python-and-r-charts-with-interactive-controls-buttons-dropdowns-and-sliders/) as an interactive 2D/3D plotting package (javascript/python/browser?)
    - [chaco](http://docs.enthought.com/chaco/) as an interactive/realtime 2D plotting package. Uses traits instead of variables(?)
    - Use D3 in a Jupyter notebook. See [d3-jupyter-tutorial](https://github.com/stitchfix/d3-jupyter-tutorial), which is excellent. Try out the little helper file, `d3_lib.py`?
