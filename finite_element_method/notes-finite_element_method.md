# Purpose

Collect information about the finite element method and software implementation.

# FEM software

[Nico Schloemer - Awesome Scientific Computing - Finite Elements section](https://github.com/nschloe/awesome-scientific-computing?tab=readme-ov-file#finite-elements) - good overview of free FEM software.

Some possible FEM codes to look into

- [scikit-fem](https://github.com/kinnala/scikit-fem?tab=readme-ov-file)

  - > `scikit-fem` is a pure Python 3.8+ library for performing [finite element assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method). Its main purpose is the transformation of bilinear forms into sparse matrices and linear forms into vectors.

  - > SfePy[1](https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy#fn1) is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 1D, 2D and 3D. It can be viewed both as black-box PDE solver, and as a Python package which can be used for building custom applications. The word "simple" means that complex FEM problems can be coded very easily and rapidly.

  - > SfePy uses so called "problem definition files" (also referred to as "input files" or "problem description files"") that describe the partial differential equations (PDEs), boundary conditions, function spaces and other ingredients of the finite element (FE) formulation of a PDE-related problem
