- [bqplot - github](https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot) - thin wrapper over D3.js. **`bqplot` is built on top of the `ipywidgets` framework**.
    - *...a Grammar of Graphics based interactive visualization library for the Jupyter notebook where every single component of a plot is an interactive iPython widget. What this means is that even after a plot is drawn, you can change almost any aspect of it. This makes the creation of advanced Graphical User Interfaces attainable through just a few simple lines of Python code.*
